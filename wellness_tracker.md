## Wellness Tracker

WellnessTracker (https://github.com/kadinsayani/Wellness-Tracker) is a Java application that tracks wellness metrics such as steps, water intake, exercise, and also does food tracking. Food Tracking is accomplished by using CalorieNinja's natural language processing API (https://rapidapi.com/user/calorieninjas) to retrieve calories for a user inputed query.
